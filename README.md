Flame Tests: Color Reactions of K, Ca, Na, Cu
A fascinating qualitative analysis technique used to identify metal ions based on the characteristic colors they emit when heated in a flame.

Typical experimental setup with Bunsen burner, metal salt samples, and nichrome wire
Sodium (Na)

Emits a bright yellow flame. This intense color is due to the excitation of sodium ions (Na⁺) to higher energy levels, which emit light at 589 nm when returning to ground state.
Potassium (K)

Produces a pale lilac/violet flame. The color is often masked by sodium impurities, so a cobalt blue glass filter is used to observe it clearly (emission at ~766 nm).
Calcium (Ca)

Shows a brick-red or crimson flame. Calcium ions (Ca²⁺) emit light primarily at 657 nm and 643 nm wavelengths, creating the characteristic red hue.
Copper (Cu)

Exhibits a bright blue-green (teal) flame. Copper ions (Cu²⁺) produce emissions at multiple wavelengths (510 nm, 521 nm), resulting in the distinctive turquoise color.
Science Behind Flame Tests
Flame tests rely on atomic emission spectroscopy. When a metal salt is heated in a flame, the heat energy excites the metal ions' electrons to higher energy levels. As these electrons return to their ground state, they release excess energy in the form of light photons. Each metal has a unique electron configuration, so the emitted photons have specific wavelengths (colors) that act as a "fingerprint" for the element.
The flame provides the activation energy needed for electron excitation. The temperature of the Bunsen burner flame (typically 800-1000°C) is sufficient to vaporize the metal salts and excite their electrons. This simple yet effective technique has been used by chemists for over a century to identify unknown metal ions in samples.
